# Working for the man: or how I learned to stop worrying and give a shit

## Abstract

I meet many engineers who focus largely on simply writing really good code. While for many this is enough, I find it much more rewarding to think about and provide direction for the product as well. 

I will talk about my experience of working at Engine Yard as it made two fairly major changes in the direction of the company, and how engineers can help provide that direction.
