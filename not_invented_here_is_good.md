# Why NIH is a good thing

## Abstract

Developers share two big desires way too often: They tend to negate the use of libraries and want to re-write whatever they can from scratch. And they are not satisfied until they've over engineered the most simple task.

While some smart asses have identified this as the source of many evils I am here to tell you: they are not!

In the time of "micro frameworks" and dependency lists growing faster than your own code base, this talk is about sane ways to re-invent the wheel, about oportunities to keep your projects clean exactly because you have decided on not to use libraries. And in the end it's just a big call to action to get shit done and keep it simple.
