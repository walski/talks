# Dry.js

## Abstract

Modern web applications, using JS MVC frameworks like Backbone, Eyeballs, or Sproutcore are becoming more and more popular. Modern browsers are powerful and feature-full enough to write entire apps in the browser. The problem comes in that in almost all cases you will also have a server side framework as well. You need to define many of the same things on both sides of the http pipe. Models on both sides, routes (especially with pushState), validations, and templates all would benefit from shared code.

Dry.js is an attempt to avoid having to duplicate this logic between a JS MVC client framework and a Ruby MVC server framework. It should be easy to accomplish this in a way that makes sense on both sides.
