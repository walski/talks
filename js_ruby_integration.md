# JS/Ruby integration

## Abstract

Ruby and JS are growing together quickly, and unsurprisingly this can throw many obstacles in our way.

This talk shows how to integrate the two worlds seamlessly and without pain. It will show paths to DRY up your business logic, ways to integrate your JS specs in your Ruby testing environment / CI, and last but not least how to maximize your benefits from using JS together with Ruby.
