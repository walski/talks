# Periscope Depth

## Abstract

Rails is, hands down, the one stop solution for all web problems that involve Ruby. But from time to time it comes in very handy to know your way a little left and right of this well worn path. This talk gives you a whirlwind tour through the lesser known web components of the Ruby ecosystem. Learn how to:

* serve static pages which compile CoffeeScript/SASS/Less/… with ease
* stream logs/files/… without Rails
* build JavaScript MVC apps that has to keep some secrets (let's say S3 keys)
* mix all these
* deploy them in no time
* make them configurable

It's not Rails, but so close - periscope depth!

## Details

The talk aims at intermediate developers who do Rails for a living. Those keen to go down the rabbit whole and see what drives Rails and what Ruby has to offer beyond the walled garden Rails can become. It's an adventure, it's fast paced and purely example driven. My goal is to get you excited to play around and deploy at least 10 apps over the next week.

## Behind the digital curtain

Rack, Sinatra and Padrino will play their roles, and there will be guest appearances by Tilt, Brochure and rest-client. Expect the unexpected!
