# Tales from the Startup's SOA Toolbox

## Abstract

I am going to tell you a story about a boy who went out to build an awesome paltform for indie game developers. But this aint no tale for the fainthearted! Boy will struggle, fight, fall on his face but finally he will succeed!

Join little boy on it's journey and learn about dangers, pitfalls and little tricks when building a SaaS from scratch in an always understaffed startup. 

## Description

Building a SOA while having to worry about running out of money any moment now presents it's very own challenge. Under those circumstances sticking to elegant and clean design principles becomes especially hard. I am going to present a pragmatic approach based on all the things I have pickep up along the way of building Quarter Spiral's platform servcies.  This will include advice and best practices on how your system can easily:

* be tested
* be documented
* be deployed & operated
* leverage the client's power (a.k.a. let the browser do the heavy lifting)
* be developed (how on earth do you make your system work on the designer's machine?)

In the end I want you to be able to put together a small service oriented system, make it run on the Windows machine of your bizdev guy, deploy it to the web, stay sane during the whole process and still have some time to play with the kids afterwards.
