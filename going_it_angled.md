# Doing it angled - Musings with AngularJS

My talks gives you a brief intro into the world of AngularJS first before I walk you through  the learnings we've had here at Quarter Spiral while building our new product with AngularJS.

It covers the best-practices and anti-patterns of how to get you started on Angular, grow and deploy your app. In addition to that I will give insight on how we use Angular with our Ruby backends and what problems we've faced in their collaboration.

In a last part I will cover testing scenarios with Angular.
