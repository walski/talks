# Doing it angled - Musings with AngularJS

My talk takes all the learnings we've had here at Quarter Spiral while building our new product with AngularJS. It covers the best-practices and anti-patterns of how to get you started on Angular, grow and deploy your app. In addition to that I will give insight on our Ruby backend infrastructure, how it is playing well along with Angular and what problems we've faced in their collaboration.

In a last part I will give you a rough overview on how we managed good and continuos test coverage for the whole project.
