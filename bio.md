Thorben Schröder is founder of “kopfmaschine”, a German Rails shop located in Bremen, northern Germany.

He has a crush on Rails till he first got his feet wet in late 2006 and never looked back ever since. He graduated from University with a bachelor report on how to scale large Rails applications.

Together with Jan Steinmetz Thorben has founded “kopfmaschine” in 2010 where they deliver web development to the German market. Beside normal web apps “kopfmaschine” is looking to bring their knowledge to customers who would not normally look for a web solution. Therefore they have built HTML5 apps that are used as “native” apps on Windows or mobile clients like the iPad.
