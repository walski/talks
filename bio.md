Thorben Schröder is founder of “kopfmaschine”, a German Rails shop located in Bremen, northern Germany.

Even while in University, he lived & breathed Ruby since 2006 and did his thesis on how to scale large Rails applications.

Together with Jan Steinmetz, Thorben founded “kopfmaschine” in 2010 where they deliver web development to the German market. Beside normal web apps “kopfmaschine” is looking to bring their knowledge to customers who would not normally look for a web solution. Therefore they have built HTML5 apps that are used as “native” apps on Windows or mobile clients like the iPad.
