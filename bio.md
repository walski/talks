Thorben Schröder is founder of “kopfmaschine”, a German Rails shop located in Bremen, northern Germany.

Even while in University, he lived & breathed Ruby since 2006 and did his thesis on how to scale large Rails applications.

Together with Jan Steinmetz, Thorben founded “kopfmaschine” in 2010 where they deliver web development to the German market. Beside normal web apps “kopfmaschine” is looking to bring their knowledge to customers who would not normally look for a web solution. Therefore they have built HTML5 apps that are used as “native” apps on Windows or mobile clients like the iPad.


I am Thorben, co-founder of Quarter Spiral, Engine Yard, San Francisco alumni and former founder of the German Rails shop ``kopfmaschine``. I am living and breathing the web since my days at University and take a lot of pride in bringing German craftsmanship to it.
 

I am Thorben, co-founder of Quarter Spiral, Engine Yard, San Francisco alumni and former founder of the German Rails shop ``kopfmaschine``. As a developer I create large scale web applications. This holds true since my degree in computer science which was on "Scaling large Rails applications" and continued throughout my work at kopfmaschine and Engine Yard where I've built, maintained and migrated service-oriented architecture projects of all sorts. As a public speaker I share the insights on that with people from Baltimore to Singapore and from Gothenburg over Berlin to Dnipropetrovsk.
